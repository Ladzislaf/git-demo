Oh yeah take the house
Oh yes, live in it
Oh yes choke in it
And we will rebuild

Bait is poison
Fed up of super ideas
They say: "Start with yourself"
I killed the Empire in me
The owner turns purple
We can't be evicted

-- feature branch --
On our flag
White snow and blue river (And that's it)
Bandstand is sick
Next to the war
Cancan dance
For shit pie
You - bubblegum
I'm back to the underground (Underground)
Along the Solovki bells (Ding-dong)
Where is my house
Where is my old house (Ah)
Witch cursed old house
He walks around
Under the mountain hiccups the old gnome (Old gnome)
Old Adam's apple
We are scared by a nuclear fungus
fuck old people
That lap up the blood of foreign sons
Fuck the old house
Let's rebuild
